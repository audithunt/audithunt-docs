# Benefits of Audit Hunt

1. **Cost-Effective**: Traditional smart contract audits can be prohibitively expensive for smaller projects. Audit Hunt makes this process more accessible by allowing project owners to set their own bounties based on their budget.

2. **Community Driven**: By opening the audit process to a wider pool of developers, Audit Hunt ensures a diversity of perspectives. This can lead to the identification of a broader range of potential issues and more innovative solutions.

3. **Transparent**: The use of blockchain technology ensures full transparency of the audit process. From the posting of bounties to the distribution of rewards, every step is verifiable on-chain.

4. **Proof of Audit**: The results of the audit are minted into an NFT, providing an immutable and verifiable record of the audit. This NFT can serve as a testament to the project's dedication to security and reliability.
