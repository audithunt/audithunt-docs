# Process of using the Platform

1. **Bounty Posting**: The project owner logs into the Audit Hunt platform using their GitHub account and creates a new audit bounty. They specify the details of their smart contract, set the bounty amount, and post the bounty on the platform.

2. **Community Audit**: Developers from around the world can see the bounty, review the associated smart contract, identify potential vulnerabilities, and submit their findings along with proposed solutions.

3. **Bounty Distribution**: After the specified bounty period ends, the project owner reviews the contributions, approves the developers to be rewarded, and the platform distributes the bounty according to the owner's instructions.

4. **Audit Report Generation and NFT Minting**: Once the bounty distribution is complete, an audit report is automatically generated. The report contains a summary of the audit process, issues identified, solutions provided, and contributors involved. This report is then minted as an NFT and transferred to the project owner.

5. **Platform Fee Processing**: The platform fee deducted from the bounty is used to buy back and burn HUNT tokens, contributing to the overall value of the HUNT ecosystem.


Audit Hunt is designed to be user-friendly and effective, offering a unique solution to smart contract auditing and contributing to a more secure and robust blockchain landscape.
