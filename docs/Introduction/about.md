# What is Audit Hunt?

[Audit Hunt](https://audithunt.xyz/) is a decentralized smart contract audit platform built to leverage the collective intelligence and skills of the blockchain development community. It is designed to help small to medium-sized blockchain projects conduct thorough and reliable smart contract audits at a fraction of the typical cost.

Utilizing a bounty-based system, the platform encourages developers from around the world to participate in the audit process. The end result of the audit is minted as an NFT (Non-Fungible Token) that provides a transparent, immutable record of the audit process.
