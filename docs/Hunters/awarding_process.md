# Awarding Process

The awarding process within Audit Hunt is fully automated, ensuring efficiency and accuracy in bounty distribution.

## Automated Award Distribution
- **Triggering the Awarding Process**: Once all submissions have been judged and assigned statuses of either 'Approved' or 'Rejected', the Audit Hunt platform initiates the automated awarding process.
- **Criteria for Awards**: Bounties are allocated based on the final status of each submission. Approved submissions are eligible for awards, while rejected submissions are not.

## Integration of GitHub and Wallets
- **Mandatory Linking**: It is imperative for hunters to link their GitHub accounts and wallets to the Audit Hunt platform. This integration is crucial for the seamless disbursement of bounties.
- **Bounty Payment Process**: Upon successful completion of the judging process, the Audit Hunt system automatically calculates the bounty amounts and transfers them to the linked wallets of the hunters whose submissions were approved.
- **Delayed Bounty Scenario**: In cases where a hunter has not linked their GitHub account or wallet, the bounty payment is put on hold. The system will retain the bounty and disburse it only once the necessary integrations are completed by the hunter.

## Resolution of Unlinked Accounts
- **Notification**: Hunters with unlinked accounts will receive automated notifications reminding them to complete the necessary integrations.
- **Support and Assistance**: The Audit Hunt platform provides support for hunters who may encounter difficulties in linking their accounts. Assistance is available through the platform's help center or via direct communication channels such as Discord.

## Finalization of the Awarding Process
- **Confirmation of Payment**: Once the bounty payments are processed, hunters will receive a confirmation notification via their registered email or through the platform.
- **Transparency and Record**: The platform maintains a transparent record of all transactions and award distributions, accessible to hunters for verification and reference.
