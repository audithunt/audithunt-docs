# Hunters Guidelines

Welcome to the Audit Hunt community! Your role as a contributor is pivotal in safeguarding the integrity of smart contracts. Below are the detailed guidelines designed to ensure excellence and fairness in our audit processes.

---

## 1. **Professionalism in Conduct**
   - **Respectful Interactions**: Engage with project developers and fellow auditors in a courteous and professional manner. Respectful dialogue fosters a collaborative and productive audit environment.
   - **Ethical Standards**: Uphold the highest ethical standards. This includes honesty in reporting findings, confidentiality where required, and avoiding conflicts of interest.

---

## 2. **Comprehensive Audits**
   - **In-Depth Analysis**: Delve deeply into the smart contracts' functionalities. Understand not just the surface operations but also the underlying logic and potential edge cases.
   - **Best Practices and Security**: Check for adherence to coding best practices and scrutinize for security vulnerabilities. Your goal is to ensure the contract is robust against potential attacks and failures.
   - **Interaction with Other Contracts**: Evaluate how the contract interacts with other contracts and external systems. This holistic view is crucial for identifying potential vulnerabilities that may not be apparent in isolation.

---

## 3. **Clarity in Reporting**
   - **Detailed Documentation**: Clearly document any vulnerabilities or areas for improvement. Describe the issue, its location in the code, and why it's a concern.
   - **Implications and Recommendations**: Discuss the potential implications of the issue if it remains unresolved. Provide constructive recommendations or fixes.

---

## 4. **Independent Verification of Vulnerabilities**
   - **Avoid Duplication**: Independently verify each finding. Duplicate reports on already identified issues do not contribute to the efficiency of the audit process.
   - **Validate Findings**: Ensure that your reported vulnerabilities are accurate and reproducible. This step is crucial for maintaining the credibility of the audit process.

---

## 5. **Adherence to Deadlines**
   - **Time Management**: Be aware of and strictly adhere to the submission deadlines. Efficient time management is key to ensuring your contributions are considered for bounties.
   - **Impact of Late Submissions**: Understand that submissions beyond the deadline may be excluded from bounty eligibility, which underscores the importance of timely reporting.

---

## 6. **Commitment to Ongoing Learning**
   - **Stay Updated**: The blockchain field is rapidly evolving. Stay informed about the latest in security research, tools, and best practices.
   - **Continuous Improvement**: Regularly update your skills and knowledge. This commitment not only enhances your auditing proficiency but also contributes to the overall strength of the Audit Hunt community.
