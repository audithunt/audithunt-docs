# Platform Fee Explanation

The Audit Hunt platform charges a platform fee to support its operations and contribute to the value of its native token, the HUNT token. This fee is set at 5% of the total bounty placed by the project owner.

Here's how the platform fee works:

When a project owner posts a bounty for a smart contract audit, the specified bounty amount is transferred to the Audit Hunt platform. The platform then deducts a 5% fee from this bounty amount.

This fee is divided into two parts:

1. **Platform Operations (3%)**: The majority of the fee, which is 3%, is used to support the operational costs of the platform. This includes but is not limited to development, maintenance, user support, and the implementation of new features and improvements. By charging this fee, we ensure the sustainable operation and continual improvement of the Audit Hunt platform.

2. **HUNT Token Buyback and Burn (2%)**: The remaining 2% of the fee is used to buy back HUNT tokens from the market and burn them. "Burning" refers to the process of permanently removing tokens from circulation, which decreases the total supply of the token. This can help increase the value of the remaining tokens over time, benefiting HUNT token holders. This mechanism aligns the interests of the platform with those of the token holders, promoting a healthy ecosystem around the Audit Hunt platform and the HUNT token.

The platform fee ensures that Audit Hunt can continue to provide a valuable service to blockchain projects and developers, while also maintaining a thriving ecosystem around its native HUNT token.
